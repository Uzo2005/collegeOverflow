### What is this?
This is Stack Overflow but for applying to College

### Why do this?
Most of the resources for applying to Colleges in the USA where not designed for International students like me, so I decided to build a website where people (mostly internationals like me) can share and document the non-obvious details in their application process for the benefit of others. Also people can ask questions (just like on Stack Overflow), get answers that work and other people with similar problems will learn from them.

### Where is the link to this project?
Am sorry this site is still in active development and I have not deployed it yet. I want to reach an MVP before pushing it to the world :)
